        <h2>Career Experience</h2>
        <p class="no-indent">I am a highly qualified high school English teacher with over 10 years of experience in the education field. 
            Throughout my career as a teacher, I have developed strong skills in curriculum design and lesson planning as well as a deep understanding of the principles of effective instruction. 
            I have also had the opportunity to work with various educational technologies, including learning management systems, 
            and I have gained valuable experience in creating and delivering online content.</p>
        <p class="reflections"> Furthermore, I have exercised a calculated and methodical approach to problem-solving during my teaching tenure. Not, only am I analytical. 
            I am creative and have used my creativity to publish courses that became the model for my last school. 
            I am independently motivated, yet I appreciate team efforts and collaborate productively within groups. Additionally, I am knowledgeable in course material development 
            and evaluating curricula with proficiency in learning theory.

        <h2> Philosophy </h2>
        <p>
           As a trainer and educator, I believe that all people are able to succeed when given the tools to do so.  I aim to empower learners to use technology
           to leverage their skills and create opportunities for growth and positive outcomes.
