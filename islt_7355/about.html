      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is McKay Lannigan, and I am an English Teacher at North Kansas
        City Schools with a passion for integrating technology into my
        teaching. With ten years of experience, I have developed a deep love for
        teaching and a strong interest in utilizing technology to enhance my
        classroom practices. Pursuing a graduate degree in Technology is a
        natural step for me, as I aim to improve my skills as a twenty-first-century
        teacher.
        <br />
        I am not focused on my career, I am a proud parent of three children,
        aged 7 through 13. My family members each have their own unique interests
        and hobbies, but as a family, we all share a love of reading. My husband
        is an assistant principal at a local high school, and we enjoy spending
        as much time together as possible. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new
        technologies and finding ways to integrate them into my teaching practices
        to engage my students and make learning more fun.</p>
