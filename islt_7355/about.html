     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>My name is McKay Lannigan. I am an English Teacher at North Kansas City Schools. I have been teaching for ten years; I love teaching and I love technology, so it makes sense that I would be seeking a graduate degree in Technology. I hope to use the skills I learn in these courses to become a better twenty-first-century teacher. <br> Outside my career, I have three children, ages 7 through 13. Quincy, my 13-year-old, is a spitfire who loves trivia and musicals. My 9-year-old, Jack, loves baseball and chess. My youngest, Josie, plays piano and loves ballet. I have a wonderful husband, who is an assistant principal at a local high school. My family is my world; I spend as much time with them as possible. We are a family of readers and, when we are not running around to ball games, we are often reading as a family in our living room.
