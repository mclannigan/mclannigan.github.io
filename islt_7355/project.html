      Objective 1.1: Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and systems 
            including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support.
            <br>
         
      <br>Objective 1.2: Students are able to design/develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning;
             promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning 
             objects to support learners.
             <br>
       <br>Objective 1.3: Students are able to conduct project management activities for both design/development, 
            and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.

   <td>JamBoard Learning</td>
    <td>As teachers and staff return to Missouri Military Academy and Independent Schools of St. Louis (ISSL) every year, this group of researchers noticed the insufficiency level in the onboarding processes, 
      specifically technology training. 
      This insufficiency has led to early teacher burnout and anxiety surrounding the perceived lack of time to prepare for implementation of curriculum. 
      The long-term goals of this project are to move this training to an online module to streamline information from Human Resources, Information Technology, and administration. 
      The focus of this semester project will be primarily on training modules dedicated to learning and implementing Jamboard in various areas in the classroom. 
      This streamlining will hopefully eliminate unnecessary stress factors that highly impact our educators.</td>

   <br>
   <br>
      Objective 2.1: Students are able to conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical frameworks 
         and existing research to design/develop learning opportunities and systems.
         <br>
    <br>Objective 2.2: Students are able to manage and optimize analytics collected by 
         learning and performance systems to develop criteria to measure learning impact and talent development.
</td>
    <td>Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation: <br><br>I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection 
      and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems.</td>
